## Snake_Game 🐍

We all remember the snake game on old phones. One of the games that is still popular and nostalgic. 
I tried to create this game in the terminal without using pre-prepared game libraries and most similar to the original game.

  > Of course, for more similarity, I had to use *readchar* and *threading* libraries, which of    course can be ignored considering the type of these two libraries and the  final result. 📚
 
 * This game is written for *Windows* terminal and may not work properly in other operating systems. 📍
 * Note that if you use this program in *Linux*, it is necessary to replace the word **"clear"** in all the lines where the word **"cls"** is used. 📍

## Requirements 🔧

This program uses the *readchar* library to receive input. 💉

🔹Windows:

```console
pip install readchar
```
